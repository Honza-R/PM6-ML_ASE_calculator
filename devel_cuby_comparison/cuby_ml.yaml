# PM6-ML example 1: setup, interaction energy calculation
#===============================================================================
# Interaction energy in water dimer, the geometry is taken from the S66 dataset
job: interaction
geometry: wd.xyz

# The base calculation is PM6 in MOPAC, the corrections are added as modifiers
# This example assumes that the MOPAC interface is already configured
interface: mopac
method: pm6

# The PM6-ML method contains two additional terms, the ML correction and the
# D3 dispersion correction. These are added as modifiers:
modifiers: torchmdnet

# Note that the torchmdnet interface requires a Python environment set up
# as described at https://github.com/Honza-R/mopac-ml
# The torchmdnet modifier needs a path to the ML model file which can be
# downloaded thre as well.
modifier_torchmdnet:
  torchmd_model: "/home/rezac/Github/PUBLIC/mopac-ml/models/PM6-ML_correction_seed8_best.ckpt"

# Finally, the dftd3 interface is set up with the parameters for the D3 correction
modifier_dftd3:
  d3_hh_fix: no
  d3_damping: bj
  d3_s6: 1.0
  d3_s8: 0.3908
  d3_a1: 0.566
  d3_a2: 3.128
